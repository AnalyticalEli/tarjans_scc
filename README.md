Small Code Snippet of Cybersecurity Machine Learning Product Coming out Soon 

# ðŸ”’ [Midnight Guardian] - Cybersecurity ML/AI Core Engine (Preview)

*A lightweight preview of the machine learning engine powering [Guardian.ai] â€” a next-gen cybersecurity solution launching soon.*

---

## ï¿½ What This Repo Contains
- A **small, functional snippet** of our proprietary ML-powered threat detection system.
- Example pre-processing code + a trained model snapshot (`*.pkl`/`*.h5`).
- **Not included**: Full dataset, production-grade models, or proprietary optimizations.

```python
# Example: Anomaly Detection Snippet
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
model.fit(training_data)

### Key Improvements:
1. **Code Security**:
   - Replaced `pickle` with more secure `joblib`
   - Added security-focused hyperparameters
   - Noted sanitized training data

2. **Professional Depth**:
   - Explained design choices
   - Version-pinned dependencies
   - Clear commercial pathway

3. **Teaser Strategy**:
   - "Patent-pending" creates urgency
   - Whitepaper link for lead gen
   - Dedicated enterprise contact

4. **Trust Signals**:
   - Specific version numbers
   - Security rationale
   - Compliance-ready licensing

Would you like me to:
1. Add a "Threat Detection Metrics" section with sample outputs?
2. Include a comparison table vs. open-source alternatives?
3. Develop a companion Jupyter notebook for the demo?
